# NOT BEING ACTIVELY MAINTAINED

I only uploaded this because I had it lying around and I assumed it was still working. (it was working earlier in the year, but apparently not anymore)

## discord-dumper

It dumps channel logs from Discord. Simple as that.

### Installation

``cd`` into the directory where you clone/download it, and then ``npm install``.

### Usage

Edit ``config.json`` with the proper options (they're pretty self-explanatory) and then run ``node main.js``.
